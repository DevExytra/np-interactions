# QnA

Q: How do I install it?
A: Place this resource somwhere after the interact resource this is important to ensure it works properly.

Q: How to I add vehicles to it?
A: Follow the code structure of the vehicles.lua it is easy.

Q: Why is the server.main executing a SQL query?
A: This query clears the Trashbin entry in your database to clear out trashcans.

Q: Why is it executing the query every 5 minutes?
A: You know you can change it :) by changing the first number.

Example: 5 * 60 * 1000 = 5 Minutes
Example: 2 * 60 * 1000 = 2 Minutes
